## About

This project is inspired by T3 Stack and Shadcn's Taxonomy for building full-stack web apps using Cloudflare. The front-end React app is deployed on Cloudflare Pages, while the API is deployed on Pages Functions, which is powered by Cloudflare Workers.

## FAQ

### Why Planetscale?

Mainly because Workers currently doesn't support TCP connections, Cloudflare D1 is still in alpha and Planetscale is only provider that allows http connections.

### Why Cloudflare for hosting?

Free CDN, SSL, Web Application Firewall, Analytics, [Unlimited Bandwidth](https://twitter.com/nealagarwal/status/1645491148981510146)

### Why Workers for API?

Pay per requests cheaper than Lambda functions (Free 100k Requests/day)
